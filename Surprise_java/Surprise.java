 * What is going to be there:: 
 * - Surprise constructor to instantiate a String
 * - have some sort of method that runs a questionaire
 * - once that questionaire finishes, 
 *          >>if responses are affirmative, 
 *              -run a method that creates a sort of mini animation using images(preferably personal ones) NOT painting them
 *              -Ending should be a happy birthday sort of thing with a compilation of 
 *          >>if responses are in the negatory, 
 *              -run a method that chooses a different sort of path
 * 
 * *****throughout the questionaire method, the string will be changing to be the input types in the terminal*****
